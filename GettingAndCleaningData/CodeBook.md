### Data Set
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed the following six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected 
for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

### Data Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Only mean and standard deviation measures are used to get the average across the following:

  * Subjects: ( 30 Subject )
  * Activity Labels: ( 6 Activites )
